After the emergence of the COVID-19 outbreak, health has become a priority for many individuals. Diabetes is one of the diseases that has been on the rise for the past 12-15 years. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was also noted that diabetic people were particularly vulnerable. Because of its ease of onset and difficulties of complete eradication, diabetes is frequently addressed. We will use PySpark to understand the diabetes health indicator data set and conduct an elaborate Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). We also aim to use three machine learning algorithms to construct a binary classification that can predict whether or not a person has diabetes. Finally, the outcomes are evaluated in terms of performance and scalability.
